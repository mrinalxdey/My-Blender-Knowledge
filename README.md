![Cursed Sword](https://github.com/mrinalxdey/My-Blender-Knowledge/blob/master/Sword_Image_cycles.jpg) <br>
In the tutorial, the idea was to make it a holy sword in the sunlight, my modification was to make it a cursed sword in the moonlight and have the moonlight with its [tyndall effect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tyndall_effect). <br>
You can find a cool animation I made of this sword with a character in the repo.

Made the ocean and rain from scratch, and used a pre-built model of the buoy. <br>

[![Iced Juice Splash](https://img.youtube.com/vi/CCH1iB6OogE/maxresdefault.jpg)](https://youtu.be/CCH1iB6OogE) <br>
This was made during summer time because the weather was too hot and I needed to cool myself down mentally.
