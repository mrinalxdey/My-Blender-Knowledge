# Sword I made by referencing [this Youtube channel](https://www.youtube.com/@CGFastTrack).
![Cursed Sword](https://github.com/mrinalxdey/My-Blender-Knowledge/blob/master/Sword_Image_cycles.jpg)
In the tutorial, the idea was to make it a holy sword in the sunlight, my modification was to make it a cursed sword in the moonlight and have the moonlight with its [tyndall effect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tyndall_effect).
You can find a cool animation I made of this sword with a character in the repo.
